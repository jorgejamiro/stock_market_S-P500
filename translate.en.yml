title: <h2 align='center'>Stock Market Prediction</h2>
intro_1: **S&P 500 (Standard & Poor's 500)** is a *stock market index* tracking the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on *stock exchanges* in the United States.
intro_2: In this project, our goal is to predict the S&P 500 stock index based on the following **interest rates** and **employment rates**:
Interest Rates: Interest Rates
Employment: Employment
S&P 500 Price: S&P 500 Price
count: Count
mean: Mean
std: Standard Deviation (SD)
min: Minimum
25%: First Quartile (Q1)
50%: Median / Second Quartile (Q2)
75%: Third Quartile (Q3)
max: Maximum
comment_describe: The table above shows some interesting statistical data from our dataframe. For instance, our dataframe has a thousand data entries and the mean of interest rates is 2.19 roughly.
comment_graph_1: These two graphs below show the relationship between the S&P 500 index and the two independent variables. Whereas the number of employments doesn't show a straight relationship with it, however, when it comes to interest rates we do see a linear dependency between them.
title_graph_1a: #####     Employment vs. S&P 500 Price
title_graph_1b: ##### Interest Rates vs. S&P 500 Price
comment_graph_2: The table below gives us a complete set of graphs, which aside from showing the former ones, along the diagonal we're able to see the corresponding distributions of each variable:

comment_plane: After applying *Multiple Linear Regression* model, this is the predictive **plane**'s equation:
comment_parameters: The following parameters tell us about the performance of our model:
comment_params_result: For example, **R2 score (coefficient of determination)** has to do with a good predictability of the model as long as the value is close to 1. Therefore, because the value is **0.9** roughly, we may conclude that the model will do a quite good prediction. **Adjusted R2** simply adds a penalty influenced by the number of independent variables. **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)** is near **2%**, hence our model's accuracy is very high.
comment_final_1: Now we can assess our model's behaviour visually.
comment_final_2: Selecting one of the *Test Data Points*, we will be able to compare how close **actual** (*blue*) and **predicted points** (*red*) are.
